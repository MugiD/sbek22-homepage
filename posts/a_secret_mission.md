At the airport, a stranger offered a student money to carry a mysterious package onto the plane. The stranger assured the student that it was legal and that security had already checked the box. The student wasn’t sure but agreed because he needed that money.

The student entered a plane and it took off. Suddenly, he heard something out of the box. He was frightened but kept calm. “It’s just a package, what might happen?” — he thought. 30 minutes later, all people on the plane started screaming and gradually turned into snakehead monsters. The student had been panicking, then opened the box. He found a bomb in it, then threw the bomb and jumped out of the plane with the parachute he had found. When the bomb had gone off, the student luckily landed at a farm. Unexpectedly, he saw the stranger that gave him this package. The stranger explained everything…

Turned out that it was a secret mission to kill those monsters and the student just saved the world.
